### Abstract
 Crop yield is spatially consistent when the high-yield areas of a field (or low-yield areas) occur in the same places from year to year. Using precision ag data from previous years to design a management plan for the current year assumes there is spatial consistency, but there are few statistical methods to assess this consistency, especially for data from more than two years. Generating simulated field data from a Gaussian process, we show the use of generalized additive models with tensor-product splines on a range of consistent to inconsistent spatial trends across multiple years of data. This avoids pairwise comparisons, expanding on current methodology used for precision ag data. Measuring this consistency is as important as identifying it, thus using interclass correlation coefficients we have the ability to detect small amounts of inconsistencies across the field and locate those for improvements in farming effectiveness.
